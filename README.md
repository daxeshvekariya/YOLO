SOS App for Inter IIT

Security is increasingly important in the modern world today, and thanks to the penetration of smartphones and technology we 
can use them to solve a large number of problems. We need to develop an android application to allow people facing any kind 
of peril to signal for help to their preferred contacts and also to people nearby.

The app is with the following features:
* Allows user to set up contacts.
* Allows user to send a notification for help to all the above contacts and to everyone within a predefined radius, this radius should be user configurable with some default provided.
* The user should have an option to send some message with the help signal, and the receivers should have an option to reply back for further information.
* It should allow the people willing to help to track the location of person who issued the notification, preferably in real time.
* Think of more innovative ways to trigger the app which do not require opening the app.
